\begin{defn}

    The \textbf{left-handed Weyl spinor representation $W_l$} of $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is defined by:

    $$ W_l: SL(2, \mathbb{C}) \to GL(\mathbb{C}^2)  ~~ T \mapsto T $$

    where in the last equality, the LHS is to be understood as a group element, the RHS is to be understood as a matrix

\end{defn}

\begin{defn}

    The \textbf{right-handed Weyl spinor representation $W_r$} of $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is the complex conjugate representation of $W_l$:

    $$ W_r \equiv W_l ^ *$$


\end{defn}


\begin{thm}
    The following are invariant tensors associated with $W_l$:

    \begin{align*}
               \varepsilon &\equiv  - e_1 \wedge e_2 \\
        \tilde \varepsilon &\equiv  - \varepsilon
    \end{align*}

\end{thm}
