We recall some basic definitions.


\subsection{Basic Notions}

    \subsubsection{Linear algebra}

        \begin{defn}

            The \textbf{dual space} $V^*$ of vector space $V$ is the set of all linear maps

            $$V^* \equiv \{ f: V \to F | \text{ f linear } \}$$


            with addition and scalar multiplication defined by:

            $$ (af + g) (v) \equiv a f(v) + g(v) $$

        \end{defn}

        \begin{defn}


            A $(p, q)$ \textbf{tensor} associated with vector space $V$ is an element in:

            $$\bigotimes_{1 \le a \le p} V \bigotimes_{1 \le a \le q} V^* $$

        \end{defn}


    \subsubsection{Representations}

        \begin{defn}

            A \textbf{representation} $\rho$ of group $G$ on some vector space $V$ over field $F$ is a group homomorphism:

            $$ \rho: G \to GL(V)$$

        \end{defn}

        Let $ \rho: G \to GL(V)$ be a representation.

        \begin{defn}

            The \textbf{contragradient representation $\tilde \rho$} of $\rho$ is a representation on $V^*$ defined by:

            $$ \tilde \rho: G \to GL(V^*) ~~ g \mapsto ( \rho(g)^T )^{-1} $$

        \end{defn}


        \begin{defn}

            The \textbf{complex conjugate representation $\rho^*$} of $\rho$ is a representation on $V$ defined by:

            $$ \rho^*: G \to GL(V) ~~ g \mapsto (\rho(g))^* $$

        \end{defn}


    \subsubsection{Invariant Tensors}

        \begin{defn}
            An \textbf{invariant tensor associated with $\rho$} is a rank $(p, q)$ tensor $T$ such that

            $$
                \left( \bigotimes_{1 \le a \le p} \rho(g) \bigotimes_{1 \le a \le q} \tilde \rho(g) \right) T = T
                ~~~ \forall g \in G$$
        \end{defn}

        \begin{defn}
            An \textbf{invariant tensor associated with 2 representations $\rho$ and $\tau$} is 

            $$
                \left( \bigotimes_{1 \le a \le p} \rho(g) \bigotimes_{1 \le a \le q} \tilde \rho(g) \right) T = T
                ~~~ \forall g \in G$$
        \end{defn}


\subsection{Representations of interest}

    \begin{defn}

        The \textbf{left-handed Weyl spinor representation $W_l$} of $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is defined by:

        $$ W_l: SL(2, \mathbb{C}) \to GL(\mathbb{C}^2)  ~~ T \mapsto T $$

        where in the last equality, the LHS is to be understood as a group element, the RHS is to be understood as a matrix

    \end{defn}

    \begin{defn}

        The \textbf{right-handed Weyl spinor representation $W_r$} of $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ is the complex conjugate representation of $W_l$:

        $$ W_r \equiv W_l ^ *$$


    \end{defn}


    \begin{thm}
        The following are invariant tensors associated with $W_l$:

        \begin{align*}
                   \varepsilon &\equiv  - e_1 \wedge e_2 \\
            \tilde \varepsilon &\equiv  - \varepsilon
        \end{align*}

    \end{thm}
